Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) is the use of natural
language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically
identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment
analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey
responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from
marketing to customer service to clinical medicine. With the rise of deep language models,
such as RoBERTa, also more difficult data domains can be analyzed, e.g., news texts where
authors typically express their opinion/sentiment less explicitly.
