A focused crawler is a web crawler that collects Web pages that satisfy some specific
property, by carefully prioritizing the crawl frontier and managing the hyperlink exploration
process. Some predicates may be based on simple, deterministic and surface properties. For
example, a crawler's mission may be to crawl pages from only the .jp domain. Other
predicates may be softer or comparative, e.g., "crawl pages about baseball", or "crawl pages
with large PageRank". An important page property pertains to topics, leading to 'topical
crawlers'. For example, a topical crawler may be deployed to collect pages about solar power,
swine flu, or even more abstract concepts like controversy while minimizing resources spent
fetching pages on other topics.
